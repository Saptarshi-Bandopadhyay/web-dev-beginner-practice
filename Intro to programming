Ada Lovelace is considered the first programmer.

Js is used for web applications and Bash is used for operating systems.

A single instruction in a program is called a statement. A statement usually has a character or line spacing that marks where the instruction ends, or terminates.

The data is stored in a statement called a variable. Variables are statements that instruct a device to save data in its memory. Variables in programs are similar to those in algebra, where they have a unique name and their value might change over time.
